        <p>
            My professional career life starting when I was 10 when my brother and I
            started working a paper route to make enough money to buy a GameCube for ourselves.
            Since then I've gone to school for Culinary Arts, worked in 4 different restaurants
            over 5 years with all sorts of roles. I am currently employed as a Customer Success Manager
            for Instructure where I have thoroughly enjoyed the tech field.

            I have a love for efficiency, utilizing many keyboard shortcuts or hotkeys,
            and maintaining a high standard of quality in my work with a sharp eye for detail.
